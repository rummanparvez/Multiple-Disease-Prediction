# Multiple-Disease-Prediction

## Data Set Information
### 1.Diabetes Dataset:
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

### 2.Heart Disease Dataset:
This dataset includes the following features:

age: The age of the patient.
sex: Gender of the patient (0: female, 1: male).
cp: Type of chest pain.
trestbps: Resting blood pressure.
chol: Serum cholesterol.
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl.
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results.
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
exang: Exercise induced angina.
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

### 3.Parkinson's Disease Dataset:
Matrix column entries (attributes):
name - ASCII subject name and recording number
MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Jitter(%), MDVP:Jitter(Abs), MDVP:RAP, MDVP:PPQ, Jitter:DDP - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency
MDVP:Shimmer,MDVP:Shimmer(dB),Shimmer:APQ3,Shimmer:APQ5,MDVP:APQ,Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude
NHR, HNR - Two measures of the ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
status - The health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy
RPDE, D2 - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures
DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent
spread1,spread2,PPE - Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation

## Several modules have been used while making this project. All the modules used in this are mentioned in requirements.txt.
